# üìò Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## üîç Introduction

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis** repository!  
This project is part of the ALX Frontend Curriculum and focuses on the foundation of software development ‚Äî understanding what a system should do **before** building it.

Through this repository, you'll explore the critical processes of **Requirement Analysis**, understand its significance in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**, and apply practical tools like **Use Case Diagrams** to model software behavior.

## üß† What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software application.

It serves as a blueprint for development teams to:
- Understand **what needs to be built**
- Avoid unnecessary features
- Deliver what the client actually wants

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in:
- Reducing rework and cost
- Enhancing software quality
- Ensuring project success

It‚Äôs typically one of the **first steps in the SDLC**, laying the groundwork for system design, implementation, testing, and deployment.

## üí° Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Prevents Miscommunication**
   - Clearly defines what the client expects vs. what the team will build.
   - Avoids assumptions and aligns everyone‚Äôs understanding.

2. **Reduces Project Risk and Rework**
   - Identifies issues early in the lifecycle, saving time and resources.
   - Helps prioritize features based on user needs.

3. **Improves System Quality**
   - Ensures that all requirements are testable and
